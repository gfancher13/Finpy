This is a public repo of a project that I have been working on for a couple of months, enjoy!

The general premis of this project is to work on my python skills, data wrangling and management skills (using lots of pandas), and then with the significant ammounts of data collected, practice some of my ML skills on this data.

One of the most critical things I found throught the development of this project is that I had to think like a data scientist in the truest of terms. Meaning that from the inital collection of data in raw JSON form coming from APIs to how wrangle and format the data, to how I efficiently store and retrieve the data, to fianlly aggregating that data in a form that I can use to trian models, I had to experiment with a significant different teqniques and attempts. I wan't just considering the statistical models and their properties, I had to effectivly become what I think of as a data science engineer. not just the the theory that we learn in class, but the practical and applied day to day activities of a data scientist. Combining domain experience and knowledge with heoreticl techniques to build  a deliverable model.
